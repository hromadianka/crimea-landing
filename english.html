        <p>We operate as a platform for organizing decentralized resistance in Crimea.</p>
        <div class="cards">
            <div class="card">We act on the principle of "open source uprising": any "guerrilla entrepreneur" can start their own project on our platform by slightly modifying an existing idea or coming up with their own. More successful projects receive more support and more followers. This ensures the selection of the best protest tactics.</div>
            <div class="card">Our approach ensures the innovation of the resistance movement. We believe that the most effective combinations of tactics can be found by exploring many ideas and, through imitation of natural selection, selecting the best ones. Variation of options, combination of elements, and natural selection ensure the evolution of protest.</div>
            <div class="card">Our platform assists "guerrilla entrepreneurs" with information and resources, provides them with interesting cases and ideas to explore, and can connect them with task performers. We encourage you to try your skills, creativity, and organizational abilities in "guerrilla entrepreneurship"!</div>

            <h2>How can you help us?</h2>
            <p>
                You can help individual projects on the platform or the platform itself so that we continue to exist and distribute resources between projects that we consider the most effective and promising, including among those projects that we organize ourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also choose a project that interests you and perform a task for it. Some tasks do not necessarily have to be done inside Crimea.
